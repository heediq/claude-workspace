# Heediq Workspace — Claude Rules (root)

This is the **single contract** for how Claude works on Heediq. It is version-controlled in
`claude-workspace` and pulled by every developer, so the team accumulates one shared memory and one
set of rules. Launch Claude from the workspace root so this file (and everything it imports) always
loads.

Heediq is a B2B and B2C SaaS meeting-recording & transcription platform (D-143): record → transcribe → extract
structured requirements / decisions / open questions → push to Jira/Confluence. AWS serverless
(Lambda, EC2 GPU Spot, SQS, DynamoDB), React frontend, AWS CDK + GitHub Actions.

## How this repo is laid out

Repo: **github.com/heediq/claude-workspace**

```
claude-workspace/
  CLAUDE.md                     ← you are here (root rules + imports)
  rules/
    01-development-workflow.md  ← the Step 0–6 sequence for every change
    02-git-and-commits.md       ← branching, commits, PRs (GitHub)
    03-ui-kit.md                ← UI component library — style once, reuse everywhere
    04-loading-and-feedback.md  ← every wait is visible; the system is always responsive
    05-testing.md               ← test layers & the pre-PR gate
    06-documentation.md         ← code-level READMEs next to the code (no Confluence)
    07-engineering-standards.md ← types, security/privacy, errors, cost, a11y, perf, naming
    08-memory.md                ← what Claude reads/writes across tasks
    09-decisions.md             ← auto-capture of locked decisions into business memory
    10-consistency-check.md     ← periodic cross-repo README/code/memory consistency check
  memory/
    business/                   ← BUSINESS memory: what we decided & why
      DECISIONS.md              ← canonical decisions log (source of truth)
      README.md
    codebase/                   ← CODEBASE memory: how the system works now
      MEMORY.md                 ← index + pointers to code READMEs & decisions
      feature_dependency_map.md ← upstream/downstream/shared-surface map

## Session start — mandatory reads (every session, before anything else)

1. Read this file (already done if you see this).
2. **Read every `plans/wip-*.md` file** — these define the active in-flight work and exactly where to resume. If a WIP file exists, open with: *"Found open branch `<branch>` — continuing: `<summary>`. Still what we're doing?"*
3. Run the coherence check from `rules/08-memory.md`.

**Keep the trackers current so any session (this machine or another) can continue:** maintain the branch's `plans/wip-<branch>.md` *as work progresses* (created at Step 3, updated at Step 6, deleted when fully merged — `rules/01-development-workflow.md`), and keep the two backlogs accurate when work is deferred or lands (`memory/business/BACKLOG.md` for product, the `MEMORY.md` Backlog section for engineering — `rules/08-memory.md`). Commit and push these to `claude-workspace` immediately — a stale WIP/backlog is the main reason a cross-machine handoff fails.

## Four things that are always true

1. **Decisions are locked before they are built, and captured the moment they're locked.** Andrii
   discusses and confirms, then we build. When any decision is locked in chat, record it
   **immediately and unprompted** in **`memory/business/DECISIONS.md`** (the canonical business
   memory), then confirm in one line. Locked decisions are constraints in every future chat — never
   silently contradict one. If anything being discussed conflicts with a locked decision, flag it
   immediately before responding to anything else: *"⚠️ This conflicts with D-NNN · [title] —
   supersede it or adjust the direction?"* Do not proceed until resolved. See `rules/09-decisions.md`.

2. **Documentation lives next to the code.** Each meaningful module/folder carries a `README.md`
   describing what it does, its key files, data flow, contracts, and gotchas. This *replaces*
   Confluence BD/TDD/TP/TRM pages. See `rules/06-documentation.md`.

3. **The UI is built once.** Every visual element (button, card, spinner, layout) is defined once in
   the UI kit and reused — never re-styled inline in a feature. Every wait the user experiences is
   visible. See `rules/03-ui-kit.md` and `rules/04-loading-and-feedback.md`.

4. **The context is always coherent before any work begins.** At the start of every session — before
   planning, before answering, before writing a single line — run the coherence check from
   `rules/08-memory.md`. Fix every mismatch and commit it. No exceptions. Inconsistent decisions
   across files are a build risk: code gets written against wrong constraints and trust in the memory
   system collapses. This is non-negotiable.

## Decisions

All locked decisions live in **`memory/business/DECISIONS.md`** — the canonical source of truth.
Read it at task start (Step 0c) before planning or writing any code. Never act against a locked
decision without explicitly superseding it.
